# libvote
A vote botting wrapper for GoLang designed for Minecraft: Pocket Servers by Jviguy and JustTal.

Usage of libvote requires your own captcha solver and proxies if you want to fully automate and scale the process. Recently, the admin of Minecraft Pocket Servers
blocked traditional proxies, so you'll need to get residential proxies if you want to be able to bypass blocking.
